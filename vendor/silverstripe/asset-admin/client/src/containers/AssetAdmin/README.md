# AssetAdminContainer

This the the top level component for the Asset Admin section. All other sections and components are nested under this section.

The AssetAdmin has two main responsibilities:

 1. Handle control between the gallery and the editor, as needed
 2. Bind back to window.ss.router for URL management
